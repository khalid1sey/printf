The printf function in C is used for formatted output.
It’s an essential tool for displaying information to users and debugging programs.The printf function processes the format string, replacing format specifiers with the actual values you provide as arguments.

At the core of printf is the format string. 
This string contains both text and format specifiers, which are placeholders
 for the values you want to print. Format specifiers start with a ‘%’ character, followed by a character that 
 indicates the type of data to be printed (e.g., %d for integers, %s for strings).
