0x11. C - printf


The printf function in C is used for formatted output.
It’s an essential tool for displaying information to users and debugging programs.The printf function processes the format string, replacing format specifiers with the actual values you provide as arguments.

At the core of printf is the format string. This string contains both text and format specifiers, which are placeholders for the values you want to print. Format specifiers start with a ‘%’ character, followed by a character that indicates the type of data to be printed (e.g., %d for integers, %s for strings).

Here are some common format specifiers:

<table>
    <tr><td>%d:</td> <td>Format as a signed decimal integer.</td></tr>
    <tr>%d: Format as a signed decimal integer.</tr>
    <tr>%u: Format as an unsigned decimal integer.</tr>
    <tr>%f: Format as a floating-point number.</tr>
    <tr> %s: Format as a null-terminated string.</tr>
    <tr>%c: Format as a character.</tr>
    <tr>%x: Format as a hexadecimal number, lowercase.</tr>
    <tr>%X: Format as a hexadecimal number, uppercase.</tr>
